Run rake gems to list the libraries being used to build this app.

TODO:

 - Wiki-like syntax on long text fields
 - Campo: limite de participantes (somente numérico? obrigatório pra qual tipo de sessão?)
 * Configure production environment (preciso da ajuda do Hugo pra configurar o Dreamhost e criar o BD)
 * E-mail when session is submitted
 * Password reset (http://www.binarylogic.com/2008/11/16/tutorial-reset-passwords-with-authlogic/)
 * Search submissions
 * Add comments
 * Review session (epic, needs discussion)
 - Improve Layout (CSS, I'm not an expert on design, but I think the markup is pretty decent)
 * Cucumber features
 * Manage Roles (admin only)
 - Error page for 404/500
 - Validate foreign_key references
 - auto-select duration/session type if track is experience reports
 - O campo de mini-cv deveria ter um número mínimo de caracteres (quantos? e os outros campos longos?)
 - Melhorias de usabilidade com javascript (por exemplo, desabilitando campos desnecessários ou escolhendo valores padrão quando não tem escolha)

BUGS:

* If I try to log in using an invalid account, I get an error message "is not valid" - could that be aligned under the user name text field?
* Should max number of character for username be 100?  Is this feasible?
* Should we trim leading & trailing spaces in all text fields? For example:  "     Jenny     " is valid
* I should not be able to enter letters in Phone field.
* I should not be able to enter non-letter and non-numerical characters in Phone field.  i.e. !@£$%^&*?/<>\|'"`~§±€ BUT + () and . is acceptable.
* State field should not be a mandatory field.  What if I am travelling from out of Brazil?
* Should not allow numerical characters in City field.
* Should not allow numerical characters in First name and Last name fields.
* Should not allow tags, for example, <h1>, to be inserted in any field.
* Wrap text? [See AgileBrazilQA-01.tiff]
* Also, remove the space before colon
? After I have edited my profile (changed password), when I click on Update profile, I should not be logged out.  But if I have only changed, say, Bio section and updated, it does not log me out.
* Given I have created a user "user1", I should not be able to create another user "user1 " with a space behind it. (Usernames should not have a trailing space)
* Should not allow !@£$%^&*() characters in First name and Last name fields
* When creating a session proposal, should there be some help / description in Target audience field?  Should allow / not allow numbers and characters in this field?
* Should not allow <tags> to be entered / rendered on submit proposals form.
* Should we allow links to be in the submit proposals form? That are not website forms?  I could link to google.com, for example.

FIXED:
* How to submit a session > "Create a user" link on the main page and "Register new
account" link on the left hand column.  They point to the same link but used different words.  Should we use the same words?  i.e. stick to one. [fixed]
* Register new account button does not go anywhere [fixed]
* When I press log in without entering any username or password, I get the error message "You did not provide any details for authentication".  I then click on register new account link (or create a user link), I go to a different page, but the error message is still there.  I should not see this error message. [fixed]
* Error message for Username
"should use only letters, numbers, spaces, and .-_@ please" needs to change to
"please use only letters, numbers, spaces and . - _ @" [fixed]
* Error message for password field
"doesn't match confirmation" change to
"passwords do not match" [fixed]
* When I update my profile, I see the message "User was successfully updated." this needs to say "Profile was successfully updated". [fixed]
* After I have logged in, "Propose a session" needs to be an active link, and not just plain text [fixed]
* Second author's username, description: "Please provide the second author's username on this field." change to "Please provide the second author's username in this field." [fixed]
* The log out link is not very visible, at the moment it is buried between the links on the left hand column. [fixed]
* More spacing in Session Track, Session Types and Audience Levels pages?  It was slightly difficult to read the 4 bullet points when they are all squashed together [fixed]
* Links on the left hand side: Should we rename "account profile" to profile?  My account profile and Edit my account profile sounds too long winded? My profile & Edit my profile seem shorter & neater? [fixed]
* After I have logged in, I then change my password, when I click on update, I am logged out.... But I should not see session proposals link on the page (because I would get this error message too "You must first log in or sign up before accessing this page.") [fixed]
* When I have logged in, I can click on the create a user link, but then I an error message "This page is only available when you're logged out.".  Perhaps I shouldn't even see this link in the first place? [fixed]
