 # Host used to configure ActionMailer::Base.default_url_options[:host] as described in:
 # http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html#label-Generating+URLs
 :host: localhost:3000
 # This is used as the sender address for e-mails
 :sender_address: no-reply@domain.com

 # SMTP settings are needed if you want to test sending e-mails from your development
 # environment. These settings are used to setup ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings, as
 # described in:
 #
 # http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html#label-Configuration+options
 #
 # Example:
 # :smtp_settings:
 #   :address: smtp.domain.com
 #   :port: 587
 #   :domain: domain.com
 #   :authentication: :login
 #   :user_name: no-reply@domain.com
 #   :password: password

 # You can use Amazon Simple E-mail Service (SES) to send e-mails too. If you decide
 # to use it, please provide your SES access key and secret key as follows:
 #
 # :ses:
 #   :access_key_id: your_aws_access_key_id
 #   :secret_access_key: your_aws_secret_access_key
 #
 # To test in development mode with SES, you will also need to change
 # config/environments/development.rb and add the following:
 #
 # config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :ses

 # The application can be configured to track exceptionr/errors with airbrake, by
 # providing your Airbrake access key as follows:
 #
 # :airbrake:
 #   :access_key: xxx111xxx

 # To track user access using Google Analytics, please provide your details as follows:
 #
