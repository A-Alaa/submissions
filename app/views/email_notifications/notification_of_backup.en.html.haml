%p Hello, #{h(@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & "))}!

%p We have good and bad news regarding your session proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' submitted to #{@conference_name}.

%p Bad news is that, up to this point, your session was not selected to compose this year's program. We had a submission record this year, with 326 different session proposals - and it was a huge challenge to select the 60 (sixty) ones that are going to compose our schedule during the three conference days.

%p
  But, the good news is that your session was highly evaluated and
  %bold is listed as one of our backup sessions,
  so it can be still selected! :)

%p Stay tuned and keep your hope: if a selected author withdraws his/her session, then backup proposals will be called immediately. If your session becomes part of our selected list, Agile Brazil's organizing committee will reach out to you.

%p

%p If you have any doubts, comments or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at #{mail_to 'programa@agilebrazil.com'}.

%p We hope to have even better news soon and, regardless of the outcome, we hope to see you in Curitiba this year!

%p Our best regards,
