%p Dear #{h(@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & "))},

%p We regret to inform you that your proposal <strong>'#{h(@session.title)}'</strong> has not been selected to be part of the program of the Brazilian Conference about Agile Methods â€“ #{@conference_name}.

%p
  We set a new record for submitted proposals this year and, therefore, each spot on Agile Brazil's schedule was heavily disputed. Unfortunately, this means that many good proposals couldn't be accepted by lack of space in the schedule. When selecting proposals, we were taking into consideration the need to create a balanced schedule, with high quality content and tailored to the conference attendees.

%p
  You may see the feedback that your proposal has received from the reviewers and track organizers at:
  %br
  = link_to session_reviews_url(@conference, @session, type: :final, locale: 'en'), session_reviews_url(@conference, @session, type: :final, locale: 'en')

%p Should you have any queries, requests or comments, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at #{link_to 'programa@agilebrazil.com', 'mailto:programa@agilebrazil.com'}.

%p Thank you very much for your proposal. We hope you do attend the conference this year and bring new proposals for the next year.

%p
  Sincerely,
  %br

  Program Committee of #{@conference_name} Conference
