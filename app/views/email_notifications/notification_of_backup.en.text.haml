Hello, #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")}!


We have good and bad news regarding your session proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' submitted to #{@conference_name}.


Bad news is that, up to this point, your session was not selected to compose this year's program. We received a large number of submissions and it was a challenge to select the 62 (sixty two) ones that are going to compose our schedule during the three conference days.


But, the good news is that your session was highly evaluated and is listed as one of our backup sessions, so it can be still selected! :)


Stay tuned and keep your hopes up: if a selected author withdraws his/her session, then backup proposals will be called immediately. If your session becomes part of our selected list, #{@conference_name}'s organizing committee will reach out to you.


You can read the reviewer's specific session feedback here:

Should you have any doubts, requests or comments, do not hesitate in contacting the Program Committee at programa@agilebrazil.com.


We hope to have even better news soon and, regardless of the outcome, we hope to see you in Belem this year!


Our best regards,
