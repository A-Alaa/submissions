Hello, #{@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & ")}!


We have good and bad news regarding your session proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' submitted to #{@conference_name}.


Bad news is that, up to this point, your session was not selected to compose this year's program. We had a submission record this year, with 326 different session proposals - and it was a huge challenge to select the 60 (sixty) ones that are going to compose our schedule during the three conference days.


But, the good news is that your session was highly evaluated and is listed as one of our backup sessions, so it can be still selected! :)


Stay tuned and keep your hope: if a selected author withdraws his/her session, then backup proposals will be called immediately. If your session becomes part of our selected list, Agile Brazil's organizing committee will reach out to you.


You can read the reviewer's specific session feedback here:

If you have any doubts, comments or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at programa@agilebrazil.com.


We hope to have even better news soon and, regardless of the outcome, we hope to see you in Curitiba this year!


Our best regards,
