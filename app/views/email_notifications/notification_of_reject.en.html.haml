%p Hello, #{h(@session.authors.map(&:full_name).join(" & "))}!

%p
  Unfortunately, it wasn't this time :(
  %br
  Your proposal '#{h(@session.title)}' <strong>was not selected</strong> to be part of #{@conference_name}'s program.

%p
  We had a submission record this year, with 326 different session proposals - and it was a huge challenge to select the 60 (sixty) ones that are going to compose our schedule during the three conference days.

%p
  Throughout this process, we had to say "no" to plenty of sessions with excellent feedback from our reviewers, considering our need to design a high-quality set of proposals along with a good balance between tracks, audience levels, session types and diversity that we foster on our program year after year.

%p
  You can get access to your specific session feedback here:

%p If you have any doubts, comments or suggestions, do not hesitate to contact the Program Committee at #{link_to 'programa@agilebrazil.com', 'mailto:programa@agilebrazil.com'}.

%p We thank you so much for sending your proposal and for being part of one more broken record on the history of Agile Brazil :) We hope to see you in Curitiba to this year's conference, and we hope also to receive new session proposals from you in 2017!

%p Our best regards,

%p
